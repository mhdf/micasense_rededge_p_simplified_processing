"""
Check, accept and (if needed) draw the reference panel region of each band

The window shows one band at a time, with the bands in a list at the left (so that any number of bands fits, for example
the ten of a dual camera): the image around the panel with the region found from the QR code (yellow, dashed), the region
that is accepted or saved (green) and the region proposed (cyan), and the pixels, saturated pixels and variation inside.
Each band must be accepted: "Accept" takes the region as it is shown, "Edit region" turns on the drawing in the same
window, where the polygon can be moved, extended or drawn, and "Confirm edit" accepts it. The regions that were saved
before are shown as accepted. The vertices are pixels of the undistorted image and are saved in the file used by the
workflow (PANEL.manual_regions_file), with the origin of each region (accepted as found, or edited).

    python -m radiometric_app.panel_selector [--config config/radiometric_inputs.json] [--root folder] [--capture IMG_0005]

Without --config, config/radiometric_inputs.json in the root folder is used if it exists, otherwise the defaults.

What every element does is shown at the bottom of the window when the mouse is over it.

The logic (PolygonModel, ViewTransform, SelectionSession, CaptureSet) has no user interface and is tested without a display.
