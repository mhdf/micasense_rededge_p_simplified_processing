"""
Radiometric correction workflow for MicaSense RedEdge-P captures - configuration, validation and runner

This module has no user interface. Everything the workflow needs is in a flat configuration dictionary
(FIELDS describes each key, so that a window can be built from it) and the result is a dictionary that is also saved
as json. It can be used from Python or from the command line:

    python -m radiometric_app.radiometric_workflow --write-default-config config/radiometric_inputs.json
    python -m radiometric_app.radiometric_workflow --config config/radiometric_inputs.json
    python -m radiometric_app.radiometric_workflow --request-json request.json

The configuration keys and the stage identifiers in STAGES are stable: labels and descriptions may change, the keys
and identifiers may not, because saved inputs and results refer to them.

    "Reflectance of the panel":
        "The reference panel reflects a known fraction of the light that reaches it in each band (for example "
        "0.478 in the green band: it reflects 47.8 % of it).\n"
        "That known value is what turns camera readings into reflectance: the reflectance of a pixel is its "
        "radiance divided by the radiance of the panel, multiplied by the reflectance of the panel in that "
        "band.\n"
        "The manufacturer provides the values with each panel, printed on it and as a spectral curve file. "
        "They differ a little between panels and change with age, so use the ones of your own panel.\n"
        "# Two ways to give it\n"
        "- Typed: one value per band, in the 'Panel reflectance' column of the table of the bands.\n"
        "- Computed: from the spectral curve of the panel (a .csv file), as the mean of the curve over the "
        "spectral window of each band.",
    "Correction with the DLS":
        "The panel photo sets the reflectance scale for the light at the moment it was taken. The DLS "
        "(downwelling light sensor) estimates the irradiance, the light that arrives from the sky on a horizontal "
        "surface, from its own sensor readings, so it shows how the light changed between the panel photo and "
        "each image.\n"
        "# The correction\n"
        "- For each band: DLS ratio = E_panel / E_image, with E read from XMP:HorizontalIrradiance of the "
        "panel capture and of the image.\n"
        "- Reflectance = reflectance from the panel x DLS ratio.\n"
        "- With two panel captures, each panel used gets its own ratio, and the panels are combined after that "
        "(see 'Panel selection approach').\n"
        "- Example: a ratio of 0.885 means that the light was 13 % stronger at the image than at the panel, "
        "so the reflectance is multiplied by 0.885.\n"
        "Only the metadata of the image and of the panel captures is used: nothing is averaged along the "
        "flight and no value is estimated from other bands. A missing irradiance in any band, Panchro "
        "included, is an error.",
    "Checks of the DLS data (limits)":
        "These checks look for DLS data that should not be trusted. They only raise flags: the correction is "
        "applied anyway and the images are written. The flags are shown in the log, and saved in the result "
        "file and in the provenance record of each capture, so that you can look at those captures.\n"
        "With two panel captures, an image is compared with the panel that weighs most in its calibration (the "
        "first one when both weigh the same).\n"
        "# What is checked\n"
        "- Band ratio: the DLS ratio of each band is compared with the median of the ratios of all the bands "
        "of the same capture. The light changes all the bands together, so they should agree.\n"
        "- Plausible range: a ratio far from 1 means that the light at the image was very different from the "
        "light at the panel.\n"
        "- Sun angle: the sun direction measured by the DLS against the solar zenith computed from "
        "XMP:SolarElevation; they differ when the DLS is tilted. It is checked in the panel capture and in "
        "the image capture.\n"
        "- Jump: change of the irradiance of a band between consecutive captures: a spike if it comes back, a "
        "step if it stays.\n"
        "- Panel drift: the two panel captures against each other (only with a second panel capture).",
    "Acquisition geometry (limits)":
        "These checks look at how the camera was pointed in each capture. They only raise flags: they never "
        "change the result.\n"
        "# What is measured\n"
        "- Camera tilt: the angle between the optical axis of the camera and the vertical, from XMP:Roll and "
        "XMP:Pitch. A camera that looks straight down has 0.\n"
        "- Heading and the sun: the angle between the heading of the camera, which is the direction of the "
        "top of its image (XMP:Yaw), and the direction of the sun (XMP:SolarAzimuth).\n"
        "# How to read the angle between the heading and the sun\n"
        "- 0 degrees: the camera faces the sun.\n"
        "- 90 degrees: the sun is at the side of the camera.\n"
        "- 180 degrees: the camera has its back to the sun.\n"
        "# What is expected\n"
        "- The reference panel: facing the sun or with the back to it, close to 0 or to 180.\n"
        "- The images to correct: with the sun at the side, close to 90, which lessens the directional "
        "effects of the surfaces.\n"
        "It is the heading of the camera that counts, not the direction of the flight line. If the aircraft "
        "keeps its heading during the flight, the angle is the same in every line. If its nose follows the "
        "lines of a crossed pattern, the angle of one set of lines differs by 90 degrees from the other: the "
        "sun cannot be at the side in both. Set the limit for that, or turn the pattern 45 degrees from the "
        "sun.",
