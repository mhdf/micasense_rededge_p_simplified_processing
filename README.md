# Radiometric Correction for MicaSense Multispectral Cameras

<div align="justify">

&emsp;&emsp;This Python module provides a simplified alternative for converting raw images from MicaSense multispectral cameras into radiance or reflectance, using the reference panel and, optionally, the Downwelling Light Sensor (DLS) data to correct changes in illumination. It was written for the RedEdge-P and tested only with it (see [What has been tested](#what-has-been-tested)). It can be used through a user interface (UI), opened with a launcher on Windows, from the command line (the workflow runner) or as a Python library.

## What has been tested

&emsp;&emsp;The program is prepared for other MicaSense cameras (RedEdge-M/MX, Altum, Altum-PT, dual-camera systems): the bands, the file names and the bands that are left out are configurable, and the bands can be read from the images themselves (see [Other cameras](docs/other-cameras.md)). For now, however, it has been tested **only with images of the MicaSense RedEdge-P**. The presets of the other models come from the documentation of the manufacturer, not from images, and cameras of other makers (for example Sentera) have not been tried. Use "Detect from capture" and compare the result with your own data before relying on them.

## Quick start

1. **Install** Python 3.10 or newer (with Tkinter) and, in a dedicated environment, the packages of `requirements.txt` (or run `conda env create -f environment.yml`), plus ExifTool, a separate program that reads the metadata of the images. On Windows, the QR code reader (pyzbar) also needs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x64). The details, and what to check on a new computer, are in [Installing and launching](docs/installation.md).
2. **Open the UI**: double-click `open_radiometric_window.cmd` (Windows) or run `python -m radiometric_app window --root .` in the project folder. It asks which Python to use, checks the packages and ExifTool, and opens.
3. **Correct the example images** in `images/raw`: `IMG_0005` shows the reference panel, `IMG_0010` is the capture to correct and `IMG_0422` is a second panel capture, taken after the flight (the example images are three captures of a longer flight; the complete flight is not included). Go through the pages of the UI, described in [The user interface](docs/user-interface.md):
   - *Inputs*: the images folder, the results folder, the capture that shows the panel and the captures to correct.
   - *Reference panel*: the reflectance of the panel (typed, or computed from its spectral response file; the one of the example panel is in `reference_panel_spectral_response`), then "Check / draw panel regions..." to accept the region of the panel in each band.
   - *DLS* (optional): corrects the changes in illumination between the panel capture and each image.
   - *Run and results*: "Check inputs", then "Run".
4. **Read the results** in the results folder: a reflectance image (32-bit float values) for each band, with the name of its source file (`IMG_0010_3.tif` is the Red band before and after the correction), a `<capture>_provenance.json` for each capture with what was used to make it, and `radiometric_result.json` with the status of the run, the flags of the checks and the settings.

&emsp;&emsp;The same steps run without the UI, with the [workflow runner](docs/python-and-command-line.md#workflow-runner-no-user-interface) (a command line that reads a JSON configuration) or with the [Python library](docs/python-and-command-line.md#example-raw-images-to-reflectance-with-the-python-library).

## Background and credits

&emsp;&emsp;All functions are derived from the original [MicaSense image processing repository](https://github.com/micasense/imageprocessing) but have been streamlined to mitigate issues caused by Exif metadata inconsistencies. These issues were encountered while pre-processing images captured with the camera firmware v1.4.5 in preparation for geometric correction using photogrammetry software.

&emsp;&emsp;For more details about the steps required for pre-processing MicaSense multispectral images see the tutorials (e.g. ['Tutorial 1'](https://github.com/micasense/imageprocessing/blob/master/MicaSense%20Image%20Processing%20Tutorial%201.ipynb)) provided by MicaSense in their repository.
