"""
Window for the radiometric correction workflow

The pages are built from radiometric_workflow.FIELDS (so a new key appears here without changes) and the work is done
by radiometric_workflow.run() in a separate thread, so the window stays responsive. RadiometricFrame builds its
widgets inside a ttk.Frame (its .widget): it can be placed in any window, for example as a page of the photogrammetric
workflow window.

    python -m radiometric_app.radiometric_window [--config config/radiometric_inputs.json] [--root folder]

Only the values that differ from the defaults are saved in the configuration file.

ConfigModel (the values being edited and their validation) has no user interface and is tested without a display.
